## How did the project start?
> *From February 20 to 24, 2023 there was a virtual [IT-Camp](https://itcamp-dd.de/) for the region of Dresden in Saxony, Germany. The task was to build a onboarding app for new employees of the company [MMS](https://www.t-systems-mms.com/).*

## Why did I started the project?
> *The Team of the IT-Camp couldn't finish the project, because there was not enough time to get this thing to work. This project got my attention and I thought: Why don't You finish this?*

<br>

## Was something particularly difficult
> *The adage: 'Said and Done' doesn't fit right. Of course errors occured and it cost me tears, a lot of hours of Google search and many many debugging sessions. But after <'hier tage eintragen'> days, I finally can aver: 'Said and Done'*
